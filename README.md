# SQL WHERE Clause Bug: Unexpected Results

This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving the misuse of `AND` and `OR` operators within the `WHERE` clause. The incorrect query may lead to results that don't match the intended filter criteria.

The original query has a logical flaw in operator precedence, causing unintended filtering.

The solution showcases a corrected query with properly placed parentheses to ensure the desired filtering logic is applied.
